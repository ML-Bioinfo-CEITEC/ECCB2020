### Acknowledgements

Most of our materials build on [fastai library](https://docs.fast.ai/) and awesone [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) (notebooks 3-4 are practically taken from the course). The second notebook is highly inspired by keras MNIST example from Tensorflow Dev Summit 2018. We would like to thank fastai and pytorch creators for giving us sucha powerful tool and Google Colaboratory for GPU runtime.
