While we are in no way affiliated with [fast.ai](http://fast.ai), this tutorial would never come to life without
* [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course

* [Fastai 2.0 library](https://docs.fast.ai/) - also, see blog posts explaining the idea of [its layered API architecture](https://www.fast.ai/2020/02/13/fastai-A-Layered-API-for-Deep-Learning/) and [recent developements](https://www.fast.ai/2020/08/21/fastai2-launch/)


### Acknowledgements

We are indebted to the helpers that reviewed the content and were answering questions on the forum: Vlastimil Martinek, David Cechak, Karla Fejfarova and Ondrej Vaculik. Most of our materials build on [fastai library](https://docs.fast.ai/) and awesone [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) (notebooks 3-4 are practically taken from the course). The second notebook is highly inspired by keras MNIST example from Tensorflow Dev Summit 2018. We would like to thank fastai and pytorch creators for giving us sucha powerful tool and Google Colaboratory for GPU runtime (running DL tutorial for 70 participants and having no technical glitch is a kind of miracle).
